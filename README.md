# whammo

An Android budgeting app. It would log my spending by reading the SMS notifications from my bank. Using Google Firebase WHAMmo (What Happened To All MY MONEY) stored the spending data in a tree structure that translated into the object oriented way the classes were structured. The class structure enabled me to keep track of distinct merchants and metrics regarding them like number of visits,total/average spending and break that down further by time frame e.g. average monthly spending.
